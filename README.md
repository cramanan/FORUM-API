## The API
This API is fully written in Golang and its response are formatted in JSON using [Golang json package](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json):

Example:
```json
    // http://localhost:8080/api/users
    [
        {
            "id": "c1ec9487-5c5c-46a4-a72c-947f71bd5c88",
            "email": "wally@mail.com",
            "name": "Wally",
            "created": "2024-06-08T19:16:19.247313513Z"
        },
    ]
```

A lot of endpoints are Protected so you will need to register / login first to open a Session and access the API.

To send a register / login request, you must format it into JSON and allow cookies in order to open a session on the server:

The following fields are required by the auth endpoints:
- Register endpoint:
    ```json
        // endpoint : http://localhost:8080/api/register
        {
            "email" : "<example>@<address>.<any>",  
            "name" : "<example>",                   
            "password": "<password>",               
            "age" : "<number>",                     // as a string
            "gender" : "<any>",                     
            "firstName" : "<example>",              
            "lastName" : "<example>"                
        }
    ```
- Login endpoint:
    ```json
        // endpoint : http://localhost:8080/api/login
        {
            "email" : "<example>@<address>.<any>",
            "password": "<secret-password>"
        }
    ```
